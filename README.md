This is simple Contact Form App for collecting messages and posting them to REST API. 
The data is checked against the criteria of the fields before being sent to the API.
The entered data are checked at the time of entry and immediately inform about the results.
Until you enter the correct data in the inputs, the "Send" button is disable.
If you try to send incorrect data, you'll see an alert: 'Please enter the correct details'
